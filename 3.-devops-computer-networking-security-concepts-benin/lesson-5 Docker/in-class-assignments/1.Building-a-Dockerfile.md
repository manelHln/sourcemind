# Building a Dockerfile

#### _Docker builds images automatically by reading the instructions from a Dockerfile -- a text file that contains all commands, in order, needed to build a given image. A Dockerfile adheres to a specific format and set of instructions which you can find at Dockerfile reference. A Docker image consists of read-only layers each of which represents a Dockerfile instruction. The layers are stacked and each one is a delta of the changes from the previous layer. Consider this Dockerfile:_

### Create Dockerfile

Create Dockerfile and write there

```bash
issa@ubuntu:~$ cat Dockerfile
# Use an existing docker image as a base
FROM alpine

# Download and install a dependency
RUN apk add --update redis

# COPY description file in the tmp folder
COPY description /tmp/description

# Tell the image what to do when it starts
# as a container
CMD ["redis-server"]
```

### Instruction

Each instruction creates one layer:

- FROM creates a layer from the alpine:latest Docker image.
- RUN command that download and install a dependency
- COPY description file in the /tmp folder
- CMD specifies what command to run within the container.

### In the bash run this commands:

```bash
issa@ubuntu:~$ docker build .
...
issa@ubuntu:~$ docker images
```

or if we want to tag the image

```bash
issa@ubuntu:~$ docker build -t our-redis-server:v1 .
...
issa@ubuntu:~$ docker images
```

### Now run new container and use new created image

```bash
docker run  -d  --name redis <our-redis-server:v1>
```

### Check new container

```bash
docker exec -ti redis sh
/ # cat /tmp/description
```
