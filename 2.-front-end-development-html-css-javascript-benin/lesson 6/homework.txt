1. Write a function that will receive an array as the first argument, and an object as the second argument.
The function should return objects corresponding to that key/value.

const students = [
   {
       name: 'Mike',
       gender: 'male',
       age: 20
   },
   {
       name: 'An',
       gender: 'female',
       age: 21
   },
   {
       name: 'Lucy',
       gender: 'female',
       age: 20
   },
   {
       name: 'John',
       gender: 'male',
       age: 21
   },
   {
       name: 'Tom',
       gender: 'male',
       age: 22
   }
];

function getFilteredArray(arr, obj){
	//your code
}
getFilteredArray(students, {gender: male}) - returning all male students
getFilteredArray(students, {age: 21}) - returning all students whose age is 21


2. Write a function named transfer, which will receive a string as a parameter and return an object, in which the key will be the character of the string, and the value will be the number of that character in the string.

example:
transfer(“coffee“) - returning the following object
{
    c: 1,
    o: 1,
    f: 2,
    e: 2
}


3. Write a JavaScript function to convert an object into a list of `[key, value]` pairs.
