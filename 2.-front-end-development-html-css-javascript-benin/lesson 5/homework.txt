1. Write a function that will receive a string as a parameter, and will check whether it is a palindrome or not, returning a boolean value. A palindrome is a string that reads the same way both from the beginning and the end, for example "madam", "reviver", "civic"

2. Create the function find (arr, value), which searches for value in an array and returns its number, if found, or -1 if not found.

3. Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent number of an array.

4. Write a function that takes a number and returns true if the number is a perfect number. The number whose divisors sum is equal to itself is considered perfect, for example 28 is a perfect number, the sum of its divisors (1, 2, 4, 7, 14) is equal to itself.
